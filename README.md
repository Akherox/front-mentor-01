## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Center a card.

```html
<main class="background"> </main>
```
```css
main {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);  
}
```

### Continued development

I`m going to focus no flexbox.
